                        <p>To satisfy the requirements of RMLS policy (1) This agreement must be available to consumers before they are able to see the IDX data and must be available for review at the beginning of each visit by the consumer.  (2) The consumers must assent affirmatively to the terms by clicking a button that prominently says I AGREE.  (3) Failure of a consumer to assent to the terms must result in no further access to the data for that consumer.</p>

                        <p>This can be done unobtrusively by putting a link near the ‘Search’ button on the search page.  The link could say "I have read and agree to the terms of the license agreement" (with "license agreement" linked to the full text of the EULA).  The language used in the agreement must be exactly the language presented below, unless RMLS approves alterations in writing in advance.</p>
