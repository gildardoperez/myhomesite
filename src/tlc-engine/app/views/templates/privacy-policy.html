            <h1>WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
            <h2>Effective: 9/1/08</h2>
            <p>At MRIShomes.com, we are fully committed to the protection and security of any information that you provide to us as users of our website.  We want you to know that we truly respect and will protect
                your privacy, so you can enjoy using our services which allow us to better serve your needs.
            </p>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy discloses our
                approach to privacy and how your personal information is collected and
                used. Your use of our website constitutes your acceptance of this
                Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes.  This Privacy Policy applies to the MRIShomes.com website and the MRIShomes mobile apps.</p>
            <h3>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
            <p>Generally speaking, our website is informational.  We do not collect any personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it,
                such as when you submit a request for an Agent's free forms, request an Agent to contact you, or when you sign up for updates via email.</p>
            <p>As is the case when you visit most websites, to administer our site, your visit triggers the automatic logging of certain anonymous information
                about your computer system such as the type of browser you use, the server name and your "IP" (Internet Protocol) address.  When your web
                browser or email application requests a web page or email from another computer using the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the
                "address" where it should send the information. This is called your computer's "IP address."  This address does not contain any personally
                identifiable information.</p>
            <h3>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>We also want you, our visitors, to know that we take the security of your information very seriously and that we take appropriate measures to
                protect the files in our data system.  We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information.</p>
            <p>You need to know, however, that due to the open communication nature of the Internet we cannot guarantee that communication between you and us, and
                between us and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties nor can we be responsible for information stolen from our
                servers or computer systems by information harvesting software which may have the ability to scrape data.</p>
            <h3>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>When we ask you for information, we tell you, or it will be clear, why we need any personally identifying information from you either to fulfill a request from you or to provide information or services to you, such as when you request an Agent to contact you, request to visit a property, or when you sign up for email alerts for a saved property or saved search.</p>
            <h3>WE DO NOT SELL OR RENT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>Aside from our own use of your personal information, we do not share any personal information we may have about you with unaffiliated third parties We may, however, have to disclose, transfer, sell or assign your
                information obtained through this website, or otherwise in our possession, to a third party as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets,
                reorganization or liquidation of MRIShomes.com. We may also have to make information obtained through this website, or otherwise in our possession, available to law enforcement personnel and agencies when
                requested to do so or as required by law.</p>
            <h3>WE WANT TO PROVIDE ONLY INFORMATION YOU WANT</h3>
            <p>Also, you control what marketing information you receive from us, by simply letting us know if you wish to opt out and not receive information from us.  If you do not wish to receive information from us, you should check
                the particular communication or the corresponding sections of our website for opt-out instructions.</p>
